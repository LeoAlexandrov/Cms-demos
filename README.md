# H-Cms Demo Projects

This repository contains three projects demonstrating how to work with the [H-Cms](https://github.com/LeoAlexandrov/Cms) content.

* [DemoSite](https://github.com/LeoAlexandrov/Cms-demos/tree/master/DemoSite) - A simple website showcasing H-Cms features. [Learn more...](https://github.com/LeoAlexandrov/Cms-demos/tree/master/DemoSite)
* [GrpcDemo](https://github.com/LeoAlexandrov/Cms-demos/tree/master/GrpcDemo) - A console app demonstrating how a content-consuming app can interact with the H-Cms service using the gRPC protocol. It sends gRPC requests to the H-Cms service and displays the responses, allowing you to explore the H-Cms ViewModels returned by the gRPC API. This app requires a running local instance of [H-Cms](https://github.com/LeoAlexandrov/Cms).
* [RestDemo](https://github.com/LeoAlexandrov/Cms-demos/tree/master/RestDemo) - A console app similar to [GrpcDemo](https://github.com/LeoAlexandrov/Cms-demos/tree/master/GrpcDemo) sending REST requests to the [real H-Cms service](https://admin.h-cms.net) with live data.
