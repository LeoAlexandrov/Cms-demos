# H-Cms demo projects

This repository contains three projects demonstrating how to work with the [H-Cms](https://github.com/LeoAlexandrov/Cms) content.

[DemoSite](https://github.com/LeoAlexandrov/Cms-demos/tree/master/DemoSite) - a simple website showcasing H-Cms features. [Learn more...](https://github.com/LeoAlexandrov/Cms-demos/tree/master/DemoSite)

[GrpcDemo](https://github.com/LeoAlexandrov/Cms-demos/tree/master/GrpcDemo) - a console app demonstrating how content consuming app
can interact with the H-Cms service using gRPC protocol. It sends gRPC requests to the H-Cms service and displays the responses, 
allowing to explore H-Cms ViewModels returned by the gRPC API. This app requires a running local instance of the [H-Cms](https://github.com/LeoAlexandrov/Cms).

[RestDemo](https://github.com/LeoAlexandrov/Cms-demos/tree/master/RestDemo) - a console app similar to [GrpcDemo](https://github.com/LeoAlexandrov/Cms-demos/tree/master/GrpcDemo)
sending REST requests to the real H-Cms service with real data.
